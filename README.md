# weather-api-viz
Visualization of weather data using API interfaces. Visualizations can be found in `/output` and more detailled write-ups are available within the Visualizations section of the `WeatherAPI.ipynb` file. The `VacationAPI.ipynb` file was meant to be used for an additional challenge but that proved impractical.

If you want to run this program locally, you can either use the provided CSV file (and modify `WeatherAPI.ipynb` accordingly) or create an account on [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org) and provide your own API key in a `.py` file named `api_keys.py`.
